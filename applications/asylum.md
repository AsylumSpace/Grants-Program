## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Asylum is a metaverse for next generation gaming.

Our vision of the future of gaming is unicity between the games: interoperability of the in-game items, unified economics, cross-game gameplay, etc. Nothing of that can be achieved without users' trust and here is where blockchain gaming is becoming a solution. Thanks to the migration of the games' economics and in-game items to the blockchain, players don't have to trust some particular game publishers or marketplaces and the game economy and world will become more stabilized.

But in fact, it's not the only thing that blockchain can give us. We, at the Asylum, believe that if the approaches to blockchain gaming will be standardized we will achieve much more than just trust - we can achieve the real metaverse experience, where will be no borders between the games and no limits for the creative minds. With the creation of basic building blocks for the gaming metaverse, we want to do for crypto gaming what Polkadot doing for the blockchains.

The ecosystem and standards of the Asylum are not going to be related to some specific blockchain, as the new chains, more suitable for games, can be created anytime. And in addition, the requirements of game developers can differ and we are not seeking to limit their choice. So, we are developing Asylum to support firstly substrate-based chains, as they are developed with interoperability in mind. Particularly Polkadot, as it provides access to the ecosystem of many different parachains with various possibilities and bridges to the most popular chains.

### Project Details

The asylum project is about building the ecosystem, where every сomponent is connected with each other, achieving a synergy.

So, the best way to give a detailed description of the Asylum - is to define its main components:

- **Interoperability standards**

The standard for storing the metadata will be used for NFT, representing **in-game items**. The main goal of this standard is to make every item as independent of the concrete game as possible. Storing various possible interpretations will give the ability to use them in different games.
Based on this standard we plan also to introduce the **standard for Avatar** - player's identity in a virtual space. Like in-game items, Avatar standard will make it compatible with different games.

Also, besides the mentioned standards, we will create the **standard for game distribution** system using NFTs - one for developers, as the confirmation of their ownership, and another for players, like NFT-tickets to the game.


- **On-chain metaverse ecosystem**

The part of the Asylum project is an on-chain code (on layer 1, or layer 3), that gives the basic functionality to the games based on the blockchain.
**"Core" block** will cover the operations with the standards, defined below. Also, there will be an **Economic block**, which will include, but is not limited to Marketplace and token swap contracts to unite the economy of the games. And in addition, we want to extend our ecosystem with **gameplay helpers block**, such as a smart-contract for creating contracts between players, or any other repeatable gameplay logic that can be moved to the blockchain.

- **Framework for ecosystem integration**

As all functionality mentioned below is meant to be used by clients (apps, games) we will provide a framework for easy ecosystem integration.

- **Application with admin tools**

For game development studios will be created an **"Admin console"** - web app, where the game admin will be able to operate the game: add new items, tokens, etc.

- **Application with players interface**

For players, Asylum will provide an application, similar to the common gaming platforms (like Steam) with Game store, Library, Inventory, and Avatar pages. Also, there will be introduced the **Creator studio** which will be used as a UGC tool - for the creation of the new items or adding interpretations for the existing ones.

A simple scheme with Asylum ecosystem components:

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The Polkadot ecosystem should be very attractive for blockchain-based games development, thanks to the possibilities, that parachains opens. Such standards will help create a basis for game development and tools will help developers save their time. So, eventually, Asylum's mission is to create the ecosystem that accelerates games development in the Polkadot network, bringing a gaming experience to a new level.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience is game development studios and their user base (players).

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Asylum is seeking to become a starting point for the development of blockchain-based games.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

There is the [RMRK](https://www.rmrk.app/) project in the Kusama ecosystem. We're considering their standards as a starting point for creating ours.

- If so, how is your project different?

The main difference is that Asylum builds a complete ecosystem for gaming when RMRK is only providing a standard for NFTs and tools.

Speaking particularly about standards, RMRK provides a basic standard for NFT legos, but Asylum wants to extend it to make a ready-to-use standard for an in-game item.

## Development Status :open_book:

Asylum was firstly implemented on the Solana Ignition hackathon in its initial idea.
After that, the project received its first positive feedback from game developers and multiple VCs and Supercolony venture studio entered the project as a co-founder. Was held two strategical sessions, the concept was largely clarified and reworked. For now, we already have such partners as Darvinia Network and Evolution land (first DeFi game) and conversations with games such as Eizper Chain, Wind metaverse, SpaceFalcon.io. Also, we have already raised the first money from Mempool ventures and speaking with other VCs (Hillrise Group, Woodstock Fund, 500 Startups, and others).

Materials which was implemented during the time of the hackathon:
- [Repository of Asylum demo made for Solana Ignition hackathon](https://github.com/LastSymbol0/Asylum),
- [Basic SDK for interactions with the Asylum programs and data](https://github.com/LastSymbol0/asylum-sdk),

| 0b.    | Documentation                   | We will provide a repository with documentation for the defined standard of NFT metadata in the format of text docs (most likely in .md). Also, examples of metadata will be provided. |
| 0c.    | Testing Guide                   | For manually testing we will provide a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can interact with the testing environment - go through a "happy path" which includes running a node, hosting web-app and games, minting the NFT in specified standard and trying to use it in two games. For implemented standard unit tests will be provided along with a guide on how to run them. |

## Future Plans

As was described in the 'Overview' section, Asylum is a big project which has ambitious plans for the future. The milestones described in this grant application are about to become the first step for building a huge ecosystem for crypto gaming.

In our plans, the launch of the Asylum platform is set for the end of the 2022 year, but we are planning to support and extend our product long-term. Also, we would like not only to build but also empower real metaverse gaming by creating Asylum Studio - an independent team that will develop games on top of the Asylum ecosystem.
